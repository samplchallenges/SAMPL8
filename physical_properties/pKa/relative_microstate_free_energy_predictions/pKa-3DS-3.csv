# RELATIVE FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS (for pKa prediction),,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:,,,,,,
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.,,,
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# PREDICTION SECTION,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# It is mandatory to submit relative free energy (RFE) predictions for all 23 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.,,,,,,
# Please report RFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and RFE model uncertainty.,,,,,,
# Note that we here follow the same sign convention and submission format as the SAMPL7 pKa challenge.,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:,,,,,,
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty,
#,,,,,,
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:,,,,,
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#,,,,,,
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SAMPL8-X_extra001` (number can vary),,,,,,
# Also email us the `.mol2` file of your microstate with explicit hydrogens and correct bond orders,,,,,,
# Please send the `.mol2` file to the email listed on the instructions page.,,,,,,
#,,,,,,
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.,,,,,,

Workflow
"1) We used COSMOquick to generate possible tautomeric and ionic states. Irrelevant states where discarded due to an internal energy threshold implemented in COSMOquick. In a subsequent manual check we discarded all dissociated structures. After a first DFT optimization we checked the relative energies of the microstates with same charge and reduced the number of states with an energy threshold. We performed DFT optimizations of the SAMPL8 microstates proposals and checked the structures against the already created microstates. Missing, energetically relevant structures were added to the set."
2) COSMOconf was used to create the conformer set of the microstates.
4)  The conformer sets of the microstates were used to calculate the pKa values of the reactions between the microstates. We used the COSMO-RS theory with the BP-TZVPD-FINE 21 parametrization. The pKa values were predicted using a LFER approach based on the fee Gibbs energies of the microstates at infinite dilution in water.
"We normally use two LFER fits, one for the pKa (HA +H2O -> H3O+ + A-) and one for the pKa of the conjugated base (BH+ + H2O -> B + H3O+). Here we used the pKa model for all reactions. The RSME value of this model in kcal/mol for HA +H2O -> H3O+ + A- reactions is 0.7."
The COSMO-RS algorithm by itself has no statistical error. The overall workflow including the conformational search (or molecule or state) has a statistical noise smaller than 0.1 kcal/mol.
