# RELATIVE FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS (for pKa prediction)
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit relative free energy (RFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report RFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and RFE model uncertainty.
# Note that we here follow the same sign convention and submission format as the SAMPL7 pKa challenge.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SAMPL8-X_extra001` (number can vary)
# Also email us the `.mol2` file of your microstate with explicit hydrogens and correct bond orders,
# Please send the `.mol2` file to the email listed on the instructions page.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.
