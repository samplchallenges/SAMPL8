Method:
Geometries were generated using Maestro 2020-4/Macromodel with the OPLS3/Water force field with mixed torsional/low-mode sampling, 100 steps per RB and 1000 steps max (default parameters).
These conformations were then optimized using Gaussian 16revC01 with IEF-PCM using default settings for water at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)/PCM level of theory.
Additional stereoisomers were treated as if they were additional conformational states of the same microstate so that for each microsate only up to 5 conformations with the lowest PCM energies for each solvent were treated with MP2/6-311+G(d,p)EC-RISM using the PSE2 closure [REF1] and the resulting EC-RISM energies corrected using (c1*mu_{ex}+c2*PMV_{EC-RISM}+c3*q). The correction for water has a fixed parameter c1 = 1 since this additional parameter was found to be of no predictive value in previous challenges, c2 = -0.1025 kcal*mol^-1*A^-3 and c3 = -15.7284 kcal mol^-1 e^-1. [REF2]. These yield G_{mtc} where m refers to the ionization state, t to the tautomer (microstate per ionization state) and c to the respective conformation. The different statistical weights of conformations were taken into account by computing the free energy of the resulting discrete partition function G_{mt}=-RT*ln[sum_c(exp(-G_{mtc}/RT))]. For the deprotonation process of a microstate with k protons, pKa_{raw}=(G_{k}-G_{k-1})/(RT ln(10)) and the macrostate pKa follows from m*pKa_{raw}+b where parameters m and b are calculated within the chosen level of theory by fitting to the reference data set from [REF3]. Here, m = 0.7449 and b = -150.7196. To calculate the relative free energies with respect to each micro000, different formulas must be used, depending on the difference in the protonation state. If there is no difference in the protonation state, i.e. the microstates are tautomers, the relative free energy is calculated via m*(G(micro000)-G(m2)) to achieve thermodynamically consistent cycles. Since micro000 is always a neutral species for a single deprotonation the relative free energy is calculated using m*(G(micro000)-G(m2))+b, and -(m*(G(micro000)-G(m2))+b) for a protonation process. For the doubly protonated species the calculated relative free energy is m*(G(micro000)-G(m2))+2*b, and -(m*(G(micro000)-G(m2))+2*b) etc. for higher or lower protonation states [REF4]. Macrostate pKa values were calculated using the partition function approach of Eq. 5 in [REF5].
The SEM was estimated as the convergence criterion for a single EC-RISM calculation. The uncertainty was estimated as the RMSE from the pKa training set.
