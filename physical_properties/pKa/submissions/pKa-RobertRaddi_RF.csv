# RELATIVE FREE ENERGY PREDICTIONS (for pKa prediction)
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit relative free energy (RFE) predictions for all 22 molecules. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# Please report RFE standard error of the mean (SEM) and RFE model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty
#
# If you have evaluated additional microstates, include the following:
# Microstate ID of reference state, Microstate ID of the predicted microstate, total charge, RFE, RFE SEM, RFE model uncertainty, SMILES string of the predicted microstate
#
# The molecule ID of the other microstate needs to be in the format: `SMXX_extra001` (number can vary)
# Also email us the `.mol2` file of your microstate with explicit hydrogens and correct bond orders,
# Please send the `.mol2` file to the email listed on the instructions page.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the 'Predictions:' keyword as illustrated here.

Method:
This submission uses a method that predicts microscopic pKa values that are directly related to relative free energies following the work by Gunner et al.\cite{gunner2020standard} in units of kcal/mol. Our method uses our publicly avialable database (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5027418) with recomputed AM1BCC partial charge features (AM1BCCELF10) from OpenEye. Previously, we used a DeepGP model to predict SAMPL6 & SAMPL7 molecules\cite{raddi2021stacking}. Here, we blindly test the DeepGP model on the SAMPL8 small moleculue set in addition to the following machine learning (ML) models: Random Forest, AdaBoost and XGBoost. Model parameters for AdaBoost and XGBoost follow a recent work from Yang et al.\cite{yang2020holistic}. Model parameters for the DeepGP and the Random Forest models are presented in the work from Raddi et al\cite{raddi2021stacking}. Note that similarity filtering was only used for the DeepGP model due to it's slight performance enhancements. The ten feature calculations were closely followed from Bannan et al.\cite{bannan2018sampl6} with the exception of changing AM1BCC to AM1BCCELF10 partial charges. Our hand curated training set consists of approximately 3000 small molecules entirely from open-source databases. 5-fold model validation for each of these ML methods using our database results in very similar performance.
Statistical uncertainty (SEM) for the relative free energies was calculated during model validation and standard errors for each microtransition was calculated using  10-round bootstrapping. The standard Gaussian process model automatically provides uncertainties that correspond to how closely the molecule of interest overlaps with the molecules in the training set, so no bootstrapping was needed here.  Note that the predictions reported have have high uncertainty due to the lack of chemical space in the training set as well as the lack of similarity of the molecules of interest to that of the molecules found in the training set.
