# logD analysis - Plots All
This folder contains plots generated by analysis across all submissions. The analysis was divided into two parts, the first by submission which contaians correlation performance statistics for each submission along with absolute error plots  and the second which contains error statistics (RMSE, MAE, ME) for each solvent combination.

## Mainifest

- [`Performance_stats_by_solvent_combo`](Performance_stats_by_solvent_combo/) - Directory that contains perfromance statistics data and plots associated with analysis by solvent combination.
- [`Performance_stats_by_submission`](Performance_stats_by_submission/) - Directory that contains performance statistics data and plots associated with analysis by submission.
- [`logD_all_combos_dataset.csv`](logD_all_combos_dataset.csv) - A `.csv` file that contains predicted, experimental and absolute error values from across all submissions that contain logD predictions for all solvent combinations.
- [`logD_dataset.csv`](logD_dataset.csv) - A `.csv` file that contains predicted, experimental and absolute error values from across all submissions.
