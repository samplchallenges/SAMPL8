# logD analysis - Error Plots by solvent Combination
This folder contains error plots by solvent combination generated by analysis across all submissions. Each plot shows the absolute error across different compounds for a single solvent combination.

## Mainifest

- [`MA_Error_plots`](MA_Error_plots/) - Directory that contains plots that show the mean absolute error across all compounds for each solvent combination.
- [`RMS_Error_plots `](RMS_Error_plots/) - Directory that contains plots that show the RMSE error across all compounds for each solvent combination.
- [`Mean_Error_plots`](Mean_Error_plots/) - Directory that contains the plots that show the Mean error across all compounds for each solvent combination.
- [`error_stats_all_by_sols.csv`](error_stats_all_by_sols.csv) - A `.csv` file that contains error statistcs for each compound in each solvent combination from across all submissions.
