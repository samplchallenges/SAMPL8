# logD analysis

## Mainifest

- [`Submissions_edited`](Submissions_edited/) - Directory that contains edited submissions. There were certain submissions that required a few manual edits. These submissions included NadinUlrich and Andrea Ebert. I removed single compound preditions for SAMPL8-1 from the submission files since it could not be benchmarked against other methods that had predictions for multiple compounds for each solvent combination.
- [`analysis_logD.py`](analysis_logD.py) - Main script used to perform logD analysis
