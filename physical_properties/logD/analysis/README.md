# logD analysis

## Mainifest

- [`Submissions_edited`](Submissions_edited/) - Directory that contains edited submissions. There were certain submissions that required a few manual edits. These submissions included NadinUlrich and Andrea Ebert. I removed single compound preditions for SAMPL8-1 from the submission files since it could not be benchmarked against other methods that had predictions for multiple compounds for each solvent combination. Since all of the other submissions contained multiple compounds for each solvent combination, it did not make much sense to add a method to benchmarking which contained a single data point.
- [`analysis_logD.py`](analysis_logD.py) - Main script used to perform logD analysis
