# logD analysis

## Mainifest

- [`Submissions_edited`](Submissions_edited/) - Directory that contains edited submissions. There were certain submissions that required a few manual edits. These submissions included NadinUlrich and Andrea Ebert. We removed predictions for SAMPL8-1 from these submissions, because they contained only predictions for this specific compound and no others. This made it impossible to compare performance of these submissions with that of methods which had predictions for multiple compounds.
- [`analysis_logD.py`](analysis_logD.py) - Main script used to perform logD analysis
- [`functions_analysis_logD.py`](functions_analysis_logD.py) - Script that contains functions used in main logD_analysis.py script.
- [`analysis_all`](analysis_all/) - Directory that contains data and plots generated by the logD_analysis script for all submissions.
- [`analysis_ranked`](analysis_ranked/) - Directory that contains data and plots generated by the logD analysis script for all ranked submissions.
