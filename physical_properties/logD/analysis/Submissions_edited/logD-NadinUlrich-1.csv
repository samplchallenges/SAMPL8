# LOGD PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

Method:
The predictions were done using a deep neural network (DNN) publihed in Ulrich, N. et al. (2021) "Exploring the octanol–water partition coefficient dataset using
deep learning techniques and data augmentation. Commun. Chem., 4, 1–10. "
The DNN model was developed using the DeepChem library v. 2.216,17 and Tensorflow
v.1.14.0 in Python v. 3.5.6. SMILES of the chemicals
were converted into graphs (ConvMolFeaturizer) and used as features. The
feed-forward network consists of two hidden layers with 64, and 128 neurons,
which were connected to a dense layer (with ReLU activation function) followed by
batch normalization (including a dropout of 0.1) and the output layer (with tanh
activation function). Each hidden layer was constructed by a graph convolution, a
batch normalization and a graph pool layer. The DNN was
trained for 60 epochs, with a batch size of 50 and the learning
rate was set to 0.0001. Salts were removed for the input SMILES.

The model and model environment can be found on our GitHub repository
https://github.com/nadinulrich/log_P_prediction
Partitioning of ions was assumed insignificant, logD values were calculated from
the logP values of the neutral species by multiplying the neutral fraction.
Uncertainties are proided as the rmse found in model development.
