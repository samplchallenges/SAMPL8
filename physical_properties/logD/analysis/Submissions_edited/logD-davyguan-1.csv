# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

Method:
Initial 3D geometries were selected from a conformational search of 1,000 conformers optimised with MMFF94. 
XTB and Crest were used to further optimise the structures with implicit solvation using the ALPB model in the iMTD-sMTD algorithm. Approximate solvents were selected when SAMPL8 specific solvents are not available. They consisted of water, octanol, ether (TBME), acetone (MEK), hexane (cyclohexane, heptane), DMF and ethyl acetate.
Gibbs free energy (G) values for each solvent system were calculated at the M06L level of theory with the Def2-TZVPP basis set and SMD implicit solvation model in combined Orca optimisation and numerical frequency calculation jobs. Custom CPCM and SMD parameters were derived from the literature for solvents that were not parameterised.
Partition coefficients (LogP) were calculated using deltaG/(0.001986*298.15*2.303) for each compound-solvent pair.

Empirical basic and acid JCpKa values were calculated with cxcalc using the SMILES structure of each SAMPL compound

LogD values were calulated at pH 8 for SAMPL8-1, 3, 5, and 6 while pH 4 was used for all other structures as advised in github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/issues/38
This was LogD=LogP - Log(1-10^pH-acidicJCpKa) for compounds at pH 8 and LogD=LogP - Log(1-10^basicJCpKa-pH) for pH 4 compounds 

Model SEM was estimated using the RMSE of the current method for estimating LogD_7.4 of SAMPL7 LogD Challenge compounds rounded to 1 decimal place (1.2). 

LogD values were also calculated at pH 3 for all relevant compounds
