# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

The method was trained previously for SAMPL6, entry GC-LSER. With the method already
trained to predict solute Abraham descriptors, the calculations here required very
little computing power.

Method:
This is an application of the method developed for SAMPL6, entry GC-LSER. Namely, in that work we 
trained an artificial neural network to predict solute Abraham descriptors. We trained
using the CompTox database of parameters from the UFZ-LSER database (https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=31698&contentonly=1&m=0&lserd_data[mvc]=Public/start).
The descriptors were based on the structural descriptors used to correlate logP
by Wildman and Crippen; they were updated for the present databse. The descriptors were coded up as 
SMARTS and implemented in open Babel, allowing the solutes to readily be characterized from the provided SMILES.
The artificial neural network was trained using MATLAB.

Once Abraham solute descriptors were predicted for the SAMPL8 neutral reference molecules,
existing LSER correlations were used to predict logP for all of the binary systems of interest.
Correlations for MEK and TBME with water assumed the organic-solvent phase was dry. For the other cases
the organic-solvent was saturated with water. Cyclohexane/DMF were assumed pure solvents.

We then corrected the predicted logP values involving water to obtain logD using the experimental pKa values 
released by the organizers.
