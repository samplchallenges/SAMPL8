Method:

The IEFPCM/MST method is a quantum mechanical (QM) self-consistent continuum solvation method that have proved to be a cost-effective approach for the calculation of solvation free energies in differents solvents. From the computation of the solvation free energies in water and n-octanol the partition coefficient is determined. In the Miertus-Scrocco-Tomasi model, the solvation free energy is calculated by adding nonelectrostatic and electrostatic contributions, which are calculated using a double molecule-shaped cavity for the solute embedded in the polarizable continuum medium. The IEFPCM/MST method used to estimate log D, can be subdivided into three parts. In the first step, using the Open Babel v2.3.1 software, that helped us to know the conformational preferences of the set of 9 molecules. In this case, we limited the number of generated conformations according to the number of active torsions present in each molecule. Once reviewed and inspected the correct study of the conformational space as well as eliminating the redundant conformations, the second part of the method is based on QM calculations, using the Gaussian 16 package. Then, the conformations obtained with Open Babel v2.3.1 Genetic Algorithm were optimized using MST method, both in water and in octanol at B3LYP/6-31G(d) theory level, checking the frequencies of all of them. After this step, those conformations with negative frequencies were ignored for the subsequent steps. Then, single point calculations were performed in gas, water and ocatnol at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. All single point calculations were used to estimate the Solvation Free Energy for each of the conformations. Moreover, Thermal Correction to Gibbs Free Energy was also added to all of them. The total energy of each conformer was weighted using the Boltzmann approximation. Then, an average energy for the ocatnol and water structure was obtained that permit us obtaining the difference dG Octanol-dG Water and consequently its log P. Finally, to obtain log D value the following formalism was considered log D = log (PN + PI*10^d)- log(1+10^d), that considers the log P and log PI value obtained with IEFPCM/MST and the corrrection equation of pH. For MEK and EtOAc a new parametrization of the IEFPCM/MST was performed using the Minnesota Solvation Database â€“ version 2012.
