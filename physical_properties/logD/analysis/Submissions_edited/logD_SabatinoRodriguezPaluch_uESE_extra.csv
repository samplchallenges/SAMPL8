# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

Computing and hardware:
All simulations were performed on the Pitzer Cluster at the Ohio Supercomputer Center
(https://www.osc.edu/resources/technical_support/supercomputers/pitzer).
The reported compute time is taken as the walltime times the number of processors (core hours).
Pitzer has a mix of processors. We did not specify the processor type upon submission, so a mix was used.
The original Pitzer cluster was installed in late 2018 and
is a Dell-built, Intel Xeon Skylake processor-based supercomputer with 260 nodes.
In September 2020, OSC installed an additional 398 Intel Xeon Cascade Lake processor-based
nodes as part of a Pitzer Expansion cluster.

Again, note that no additional calculations were required beyond the pKa predictions.

Method:
Starting with the initial structures provided by the SAMPL8 organizers for each microstate, geometries were first optimized with the PM7 method.
The geometries were then further optimized at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level of theory/basis set, followed by frequency calculation.
A single point energy calculation was then performed to computed CM5 charges. The final structure and CM5 charges were used to predict
hydration free energies using the uESE method (DOI: 10.1002/jcc.26531) using code provided by the authors of the uESE manuscript.
The gas phase total free energy of each microstate was computed from the frequency calculation. 
The relative free energies in water were computed from this information based on the proton dissociation reaction.
All of the electronic structure calculations were perfomed with Gaussian 16.

Using the results of the previous single point energy calculation for microstate 0 (the neutral reference) for each molecule,
we used the uESE method to predict solvation free energies in water and the desired organic solvents. Assuming pure solvents,
these values were then used to predict logP. Our logP values were corrected using our reaction free energies in water to 
predict logD, where we assumed in the organic phase only the neutral reference molecule is present.

Note that in the calculation of the solvation free energy in TBME, uESE was not optimized for TBME. Here we adopt the solvent
shift and solvent class (D) from diethyl ether, and use the experimental dielectric constant for TBME.

No additional calculations were necessary beyond that needed for the pKa predictions.

This submission includes the extra microstates provided by the challenge organizers.
