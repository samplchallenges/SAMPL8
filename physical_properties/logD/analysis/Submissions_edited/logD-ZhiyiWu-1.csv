# LOGD PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

Method:

From the pKa challenge, the lowest energy neutral microstate and the
neutral microstate that are within 1 kcal/mol of the lowest energy neutral
microstates are chosen.

RESP2 calculation is then used to decide the partial charge.
The previously generated conformer of the each chosen microstate are used.
QM calculations are done at the level of B3LYP/def2-TZVP in vacuum and SMD water.
The partial charge of a conformer is the average of the RESP charge derived
in vacuum and water. The final partial charge is the weighted average based on
the energy of each microstate from the pKa challenge.

The molecule is parameterised with gaff2 solvated in dodecahedron box
with 12 A distance to box edge. The standard molecule annihilation protocol is
then done with Gromacs 2021.2.
The coul part is done with windows:
0.0 0.125 0.25 0.375 0.5 0.625 0.75 0.875 1.0
The vdw with window:
0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1.0

The equilibration is done with 200 ps nvt and 1 ns npt with langevin dynamics thermostat
and C-rescale for barostat at STP. The production run is done for 50 ns with replic
exchange of every 1000 steps.

The free energy estimation is done with alchemlyb.

The population of each microstate is just the population of them from pKa challenge.

SAMPL8-5_micro000, challenge provided SAMPL8-5_micro000 SMILES string, 62.8% population
SAMPL8-5_micro001, challenge provided SAMPL8-5_micro001 SMILES string, 37.2% population
