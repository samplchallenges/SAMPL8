# LOGD PREDICTIONS
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following four elements:
# predictions, name of method, software listing, and method description.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown with their respective headers.
#
# Any line that begins with a # is considered a comment and will be ignored when parsing.
#
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# It is mandatory to submit logD predictions for all challenge molecules for
# which data is available in at least one solvent pair.
# See https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL8/tree/master/physical_properties for data availability.
# Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
# You must submit predictions for at least one solvent pair (eg. Octanol-water, Cyclohexane-water, Ethyl acetate-water, etc etc).
#
# Please report the general molecule `ID tag` in the form of `SAMPL8-X` (e.g. SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, etc).
# Please indicate the microstate(s) used in the `Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)` section (e.g. `SAMPL8-1_micro000`, `SAMPL8-1_micro000 SAMPL8-1_extra001`)
# Please report standard error of the mean (SEM) and model uncertainty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# ID tag, Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas), logD prediction, logD SEM, logD model uncertainty
#
#
# List out all IDs considered/input to your calculations in the second column (`Molecule ID/IDs considered (no commas)`). See challenge instructions.
# If multiple microstates are used, please report the order of population in the aqueous phase in descending order.
# Please list microstate populations, SMILES strings and the molecule IDs in the `METHOD DESCRIPTION SECTION` section further below.
#
# Predictions for each solvent pair must have their own header, as illustrated here.
#
# We recommend editing this file with a plain text editor (e.g. vi, eMacs, etc.) and NOT a spreadsheet.

Computing and hardware:
For the conformer generation we have use a linux cluster (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU @ 3.00GHz). The calculations could use up to 20 cores. The number of actually use CPU differ during the steps of the conformer search procedure.
"We have taken the COSMO files (the information needed for the COSMORS predictions) from the pKa studies, where we already created conformer sets for the neutral microstates. The timings given above are wall times that have been taken from the pKa study and extrapolated to the 34 microstates used in this study."
Compared to the creation of the conformer sets the time for the COSMO-RS logD calculations is neglectable (a few minutes). These calculation have been performed on a windows notebook on one CPU.
We devided the comute time among the 7 partitionings, although the number of partitionings does not change the compute time significantly.

Method:
Conformer workflow of pKa challenge:
"1) We used COSMOquick to generate possible tautomeric and ionic states. Irrelevant states where discarded due to an internal energy threshold implemented in COSMOquick. In a subsequent manual check we discarded all dissociated structures. After a first DFT optimization we checked the relative energies of the microstates with same charge and reduced the number of states with an energy threshold. We performed DFT optimizations of the SAMPL8 microstates proposals and checked the structures against the already created microstates. Missing, energetically relevant structures were added to the set."
2) COSMOconf was used to create the conformer set of the microstates.
COSMO-RS calculations:
All COSMO-RS calculation have been performed with the COSMOtherm software. We used the conformer sets of the neutral microstates of the pKa challenge. The conformer sets of the microstates of the compounds have been merged to form the conformer set of the compound. These sets have been used for the prediction of the partition coefficients between the given phases. The solvent COSMO files (files that hold the information needed for the COSMO-RS calculation) that are needed for the phases have been taken from the COSMOtherm database (COSMObase 21).
"The dissociation correction for the water phase has been calculated using the experimental pKa values given by the organizers. We have used pH=8 for the compounds SAMPL8-x (x=1,3,5,6) and pH=3 for the rest."
For heptane-water and cyclohexane-water we assumed pure phases. The mutual solubility of the solvents has been taken into account for the other systems:
Octanol-water: 27 mol% of water in the octanol phase (COSMOthem default settings)
Ethyl acetate-water: 2 mol% ethylacetate in the water phase  and 20.6 mol % water in the organic phase (COSMOtherm LLE prediction)
"MEK-water: 8.2 mol% water in the organic phase and 35.1 mol% MEK in the water phase E. (taken from: Lladosa, J. B. Monton, J. de la Torre, and N. F. Martinez, J. Chem. Eng. Data 2011, 56,1755-1761)"
"TBME-water: 7.4 mol % water in MTBE and 0.8 mol % MTBE in the water phase (taken from I. Ashour, J. Chem. Eng. Data 2005, 50, 113-118)"
Cyclohexane-DMF: fine LLE: 16.7 mol % cycloheane in the DMF phase and 5.2 mol% DMF in the cyclohexane phase (COSMOtherm LLE prediction)
The COSMO-RS algorithm by itself has no statistical error. The overall workflow including the conformational search (or molecule or state) has a statistical noise smaller than 0.1 kcal/mol. The uncertainty of the exp. pKa values has been added using the propagation of uncertainty.
As an error estimation for the underlying partition coefficients we use the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.5 log units with regard to experimental octanol/water partitioning data of the applied COSMO-RS parametrization (BP-TZVPD-FINE 21).
