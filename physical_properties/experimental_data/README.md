# Experimental data for the SAMPL8 physical properties challenge

This provides experimental results from GSK for the SAMPL8 physical properties challenge, as described in the forthcoming manuscript "Automated High Throughput pKa and Distribution Coefficient Measurements of Pharmaceutical Compounds for the SAMPL8 Blind Prediction Challenge" by Bahr et al. (submitted to JCAMD), a copy of which will be deposited here.

Additional data was provided by the Czodrowski lab in June, 2022, for follow up pKa measurements on several compounds using a Sirius T3. These values were re-measured because a large number of participants had significant disagreements with experiment for these compounds, suggesting there might be problems with the original experiments. Please note that these new values, which are likely more accurate, are significantly different for some compounds. At this point, we have not updated the analysis with these new values.

pKa values were re-measured for SAMPL8-1, SAMPL8-2, SAMPL8-5 and SAMPL8-22 (as detailed in `SAMPL8 - SiriusT3 measurements.pdf`; see also `.csv` format `pKa - SiriusT3 measurements.csv`). Changes were particularly significant for SAMPL8-1 (where the original experiments reported two pKa values) and SAMPL8-22.
