# Experimental data for the SAMPL8 physical properties challenge

This provides experimental results from GSK for the SAMPL8 physical properties challenge, as described in the forthcoming manuscript "Automated High Throughput pKa and Distribution Coefficient Measurements of Pharmaceutical Compounds for the SAMPL8 Blind Prediction Challenge" by Bahr et al. (submitted to JCAMD), a copy of which will be deposited here.


## Manifest
- `Aqueous_Solubility for SAMP8 Pub.xls`: A spreadsheet which gives concentration-dependent solubility for the different SAMPL8 compounds, provided by Matt Bahr on Feb. 12, 2021
- `SAMPL8 Final Readout_pH-Solubility Pub`: A Powerpoint file with pH-dependent solubility for the various compounds and corresponding experimental pKa values, as provided by Matt Bahr on Feb. 12, 2021`
- `SAMPL Structures from Smiles.xlsx`: A spreadsheet with 2D structures, SMILES strings, and IDs, provided by Matt Bahr on March 5, 2021.
- `pKa.csv`: CSV file, hand-typed from "SAMPL8 Final Readout_pH-Solubility Pub.pptx" by David Mobley on July 19, 2021, which gives pKa values by compound as listed in that powerpoint.
- `Log D Summary Calculations Final MNB Pub.xls`: A spreadsheet which gives logD for the different compounds in different solvents, provided by Matt Bahr on Feb. 12, 2021
- `SAMPL8 Final Readout Distribution Coefficient Pub.pptx`: A Powerpoint file with distribution coefficient details in the different solvents, provided by Matt Bahr on Feb. 12, 2021

Experimental data collection is described in this  [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-021-00427-0) in JCAMD.
