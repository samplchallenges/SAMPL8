# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "CB8" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.

#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CB8 challenge, G8 and G9 are not part of this challenge hence they will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

SUBMISSION #3 OUT OF #4 -- UNRANKED SUBMISSION --

Free binding energy prediction using machine learning methods:
1) All the binding data concerning the CB8 host systems are extracted form SAMPL6-SAMPL3 challenges and from the Binding Database (Host: BDBM36284).
All the guest involved in the BindingDB and SAMPL3 challenge are reconstructed in two steps from SMILES using obabel: 
(i) generating 150 3D conformers based on Genetic-Algorithm 
(ii) and the selecting the lowest energy conformers. 
This conformers are then minimized at semi empirical level using xtb-GFN2B giving us an optimized 3D structure. 
The guests from SAMPL6 are extracted from repository in their 3D format, and then only minimized at semi empirical level using xtb-GFN2B, giving us an optimized 3D structure. 
52 structures are extracted from this method.

2) All the structures are passed into the CORINA web-platform to compute 200 2D and 3D molecular descriptors for each system.

3) The descriptors of the dataset are reduced using the R software with different approaches: a) deleting the descriptors that have a near zero variance using Caret package ; b) deleting the most correlated descriptors using Caret package ; c) using principal component analysis (PCA) to combine descriptors that explain the most the variability.

In order to predict the binding free energy, several machine learning models using regression are used: Neural network, knn, polynomial SVM and random forest. By modifying the parameters and using a repeated 10-fold cross validation on those ML models, thousands of different models are generated (respectively 18.040 nnet, 19.800 rf, 8800 rf and 20 knn).
Both 30/70 and 20/80 data partition are tested and our prediction have been done in a 20/80 pratition, resulting in a set of 44 cases for training and 8 cases for the test set.

Our bestmodel, used to make predictions on SAMPL8, is a neural network using "nnet" function, which provided a TrainRMSE=0.94, a TrainRsquare=0.91, and with a TrainMAE=0.76 performances for trainingset and RMSE=0.59, Rsquare=0.71	and MAE=0.81 for the Testset, suggesting that the prediction is not excessively biased by overtraining.
