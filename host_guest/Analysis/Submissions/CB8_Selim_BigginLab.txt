Free Energy
Absolute binding free energy calculations were performed using the non-physical thermodynamic cycle. All simulations were carried out in GROMACS (v2020.2). The bonded and initial Lennard-Jones parameters were obtained from Parsley (v1.2.1). 
Partial atomic charges were generated with the AM1-BCC approach as implemented in the AmberTools.The ligand van der Waals interactions were decoupled and the charges annihilated using a linear alchemical pathway. For the addition of the ligand restraints instead, 12 non-uniformly distributed λ values were used (0.0, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). A total of 44 windows for the complex simulations and 32 windows for the ligand simulations were therefore employed. 
For each window, 10000 energy minimization steps were carried out using a steepest descent algorithm. The system was subsequently simulated for 10 ps in the canonical ensemble with harmonic position restraints applied to the solute heavy atoms with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−2.  
Temperature was coupled using Langevin dynamics with 298.15 K as the reference temperature. A 100 ps position restrained run in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble was then performed using the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm. 5 ns unrestrained production runs were performed for data collection using Hamiltonian-exchange Langevin dynamics with a 2 fs time-step in the NPT ensemble with the Parrinello–Rahman pressure coupling scheme. 
The contribution of this set of restraints to the free energy can be calculated analytically using MDRestraintsGenerator (https://github.com/bigginlab/MDRestraintsGenerator). For all simulations the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was used for electrostatic interactions with a real space cut-off of 12 Å, a pme order of 4, and a Fourier spacing of 1.0 Å. The P-LINCS constraint algorithm was used only on H-bonds. 

Binding Enthalpy
The binding enthalpy is calculated using the averaged potential energies of the system from four separate simulations of the host-guest complex, water, host, and guest, respectively. 
This multi-box approach was implemented by Fenley et al. In this approach, the number of solvent molecules should exactly balance the stoichiometry of the simulations. Bonded and unbonded states simulations of host-guest complex have an equal number of water molecules. 
The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated using blocking method without running time-consuming additional simulations.57–59 Pyblock python module was used to estimate the SEM for time-correlated data series. 

A periodic cubic water box was used for all systems with 2000 water molecules. GAFF v1 parameters and partial atomic charges obtained with the AM1-BCC method were generated by antechamber tool in AmberTools. A 3-step steepest descent energy minimization with a maximum force of 10 kJ/mol/nm was applied to all systems. 
In the first step, all heavy atoms were implemented position restraints with the harmonic potential at a force constant of 1000 kJ/(mol nm2), after those restraints on water molecules were removed and then the final step removed all position restraints. All systems were equilibrated with a 5 ns NVT and NPT simulations. 
The V-rescale and Parrinello-Rahman algorithms were used for temperature and pressure coupling to control the temperature at 300 K and an isotropic pressure at 1.0 bar, respectively. Unbonded interactions were calculated up to a cut-off of 1.0 nm with a potential-shift modifier. 
A dispersion correction was  applied to energy and pressure. 
All h-bond lengths were constrained with a LINear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm. Coulomb interactions were evaluated with the Fast smooth Particle-Mesh Ewald (SPME) electrostatics method with an initial short-range cutoff of 1.0. The leap-frog algorithm was used to integrate the equations of motion for 100 ns MD simulation runs with the periodic boundary conditions. An integration time step was set to 2 fs for all simulations.
