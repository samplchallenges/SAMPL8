Method:
Binding patterns on CB8 were mapped using our Site-identification 
by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method (10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00210)
, which employs full molecular dynamics simulations on the target molecule
that is immersed in a water box filled with eight other organic molecules 
that are representative for various chemical types. The occupancy maps or 
so called FragMaps were generated from long time MD trajectories and converted
into free energy like terms through Boltzmann transfermation into grid free
energy (GFE) maps. Guest molecules are then simulated via Monte Carlo techniques 
in the field of the GFE maps (SILCS-MC) to predict their binding conformations 
and affinities as so called ligand grid free energy (LGFE) for the target host 
molecule.

The SILCS simulations were conducted based on the Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo-
Molecular Dynamics (GCMC-MD) (10.1021/ct500201y) protocol. The GCMC part was
handled using SILCSBIO code and MD part used the GROMACS software. Ten independent
systems with randomized probes were established and submitted to the iterative 
GCMC-MD protocol yield 10*100 ns total MD simulation time.

Starting from the raw SILCS FragMaps we used the previously published experimental data for
guest molecules targeting CB8 from previous SAMPLs to train a model, where the weighting 
factors of each contributing GFE components were optimized. Using the 12 data points
collected from SAMPL6, a set of weighting factors on the SILCS FragMaps were optimized to 
give the best correlation between reweighted LGFE and experimental data. The used data points 
were from guest molecules G0-G7, G9-G12 from SAMPL6.  Here we used this model to 
calculate reweighted LGFEs for the current guest molecules. 

SILCS-MC simulations of the guest molecules in the FragMaps were conducted in
the exhaustive sampling mode. Protonations states were assigned based on MOE and counter ions 
are not included except for G5. For G5, its protonated form was adopted.
For each guest, five parallel SILCS-MC runs were conducted. 
For each run, the guest was first placed randomly in the center of the
cavity of CB8 and subjected to one randomly selected rotatable bond rotated by 
a random value (−180<φ<180) followed by a random rigid molecular translation 
and rotation. Then the guest was energy minimized for 10,000 steps of 
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno minimization with a gradient tolerance of 
3×10^−8 kcal/mol/Å and a function tolerance of 10^−4 in the context of Cartesian 
coordinates using the full CGenFF (10.1002/jcc.21367,10.1002/jcc.23067) potential 
energy function. Then the guest was subjected to 10,000 MC steps and at each attempted
moves, the molecular translation and rotation and dihedral rotations of rotatable
bonds are within a magnitude between zero and 1 Å, 180 degree and 180 degree,
respectively. Then, the binding pose was further optimized into a local minimum using
the simulated annealing (SA) for 40,000 steps with maximum step sizes of 0.2 Å,
9 degree and 9 degree for the global translation, rotation and dihedral rotation,
respectively. Such MC-SA was conducted 50 cycles, and if the lowest 3 LGFE scores 
in each run are within 0.5 kcal/mol the run is terminated. If that criteria is not met 
additional cycles are run until this convergence criteria is achieved up to a maximum 
of 250 cycles in each run. The final reported LGFE for each host is the averaged LGFE 
across three independent SILCS-MC runs, where the standard deviation was also evaluated.
