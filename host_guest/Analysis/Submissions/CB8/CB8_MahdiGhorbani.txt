Method:
Parameters for the host and guest molecules were generated through intramolecular force-matching using B3LYP for CB8(host) and MP2 for the guest 
molecules. All simulations were performed with the NAMD software. A cylindrical potential was defined to restrain the center of mass of the guest and prevent
unwanted interactions with the the Host(CB8). The cylindrical potential was as a cylinder centered on the principal axis of 
the Host with a radius slightly higher than the radius of the Host molecule. Guest molecules were dragged from one side of the 
Host to the other side along the principal axis of the cylindrical potential as the reaction coordinate through an SMD (steered 
molecular dynamics) in 10 ns. 32 different umbrellas were generated along this path for the Replica Exchange Umbrella Sampling (REUS).
Each umbrella was equilibrated for 1 ns with a force constant of 4 kcal/mol on the reaction coordinate. The cylindrical potential had an upper-bound restraint
with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol. The equilibrated systems were then used as the starting point for the REUS simulation.
Exchange attempts were made every 2 ps which resulted in an average exchange rate of about 20% in all systems.

Each system was solvated in a 69 x 69 x 69 TIP3P water box.REUS simulations were run under NPT ensemble for about 15 ns per replica using Langevin thermostat
at a temperature of 298 K with a friction constant of 1.0 ps-1 and Langevin Piston to keep the pressure at 1 bar. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained
with SHAKE algorithm in NAMD and the simulation time step was 2 fs. The PMFs were calculated using WHAM program.

Two different corrections were added to the binding energies: 1. Volume correction: free energy cost associated with restraining the guest
in the cylindrical potential was calculated from the volume that guest molecule samples in the unbound state.
2. The free energy cost of turning on the restraint was calculated using thermodynamic integration (TI) method through gradually decreasing the force 
constant from 4kcal/mol to 0 in 10 lambda states. The absolute binding free energy was then obtained through a thermodynamic cylcle with considering the corrections.

A pKa correction was also performed on G5 to account for protonation state of this gest molecule in the bound state.
