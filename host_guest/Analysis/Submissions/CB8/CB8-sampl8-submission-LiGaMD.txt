# This file will be automatically parsed.  It must contain the following seven elements:
# predictions, participant name, participant organization, name of method, software listing, method, method category, and ranked.
# These elements must be provided in the order shown.
# The file name must begin with the word "CB8" and then be followed by an underscore or dash.
#
# FILE FORMAT: All comment lines in this file (which begin with #) will be ignored.
# Please use only UTF-8 characters in the non-comment fields. If your information (e.g. your name, etc.)
# contains a non-UTF-8 character, you may note it in comments near that entry.

#
# PREDICTIONS
# Please explicitly describe how you handle ions and pKa effects.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows, with all (up to six) numbers in kcal/mol.
# host-guest ID (note that the host varies!), Free energy, free energy SEM, free energy model uncertainty,
# enthalpy, enthalpy SEM, enthalpy model uncertainty
# The free energy, free energy SEM, and free energy model uncertainty are REQUIRED.
# The corresponding quantities for binding enthalpy are optional.
#
# Note that the "model uncertainty" should be your estimate of ACCURACY of this particular approach
# for the compound considered.
#
# For the CB8 challenge, G8 and G9 are not part of this challenge hence they will not be judged, as
# literature values are available.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

Method:
All simulations were performed using our ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method, which is 
implemented in the pmemd.cuda program in Amber20 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00395).
Each system was built using the tleap module in AMBER. The q4MD forcefield with RESP charge were 
used for the host and ligand. Each system was neutralized by adding counter ions and immersed in a cubic TIP4P water box, 
which was extended 10 Å from the protein-peptide complex surface.
Each system was first energy minimized with 1 kcal/mol/Å2 constraints on the heavy atoms of the host and ligand, 
including the steepest descent minimization of 5,000 steps and conjugate gradient minimization of 5,000 steps. 
The system was then heated from 0 K to 300 K for 200 ps. It was further equilibrated using the NVT ensemble at 300K for 
800 ps and the NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar for 1 ns with 1 kcal/mol/Å2 constraints on the heavy atoms of the host 
and ligand, followed by 2 ns short cMD without any constraint. The LiGaMD simulations proceeded with 14ns short conventional MD to
collect the potential statistics, 54.6ns GaMD equilibration after adding the boost potential and then three independent 
300 ns production runs. Initial testing simulations showed that when the threshold energy for applying boost potential 
to the ligand non-bonded energy was set to the lower bound (i.e., E=Vmax), ligand dissociation was not observed for some of 
the guests. In comparison, when the threshold energy was set to the upper bound (i.e., E= Vmin+1/k), repetitive guest dissociation
and binding were observed. Therefore, the threshold energy for applying the ligand boost potential was set to the upper bound 
in final simulations. LiGaMD_Dual production simulation frames were saved every 0.2ps for analysis.
