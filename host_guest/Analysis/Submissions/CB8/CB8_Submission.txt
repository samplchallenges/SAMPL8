Method:
Amber Tools 19 was used to create the topology and coordinate files of each system. Force-field parameters for the host and guest molecules were taken from the the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF2) with partial charges derived using the AM1-BCC method as implemented in Antechamber. For water the TIP3P force field was used, and for systems with the guest molecule, one sodium ion was added with parameters from Joung and Cheatham (10.1021/jp8001614) to neutralize the charge of the guest. The stereochemistries of the protonated nitrogen for guest G3, G4 and G7 were chosen to give the lower binding free energy. An extra free energy of 0.5 RT ln2 was included for guest G5 for the shift from half in solution to full protonation when bound. The starting structure for each host-guest complex was generated by docking with the AutoDock Vina software. Four kinds of MD simulation were set up: (i) 1500 water molecules, (ii) host molecule solvated in 1500 water molecules, (iii) each guest molecule in 1500 water molecules, and (iv) each bound host-guest complex in 1500 water molecules. All simulation boxes were cubic with side ~36 angstroms.

All simulations were performed with the GROMACS 2018.4 package. The topology and coordinate files for of each system was converted from AMBER into GROMACS format using the ParmEd tool. For equilibration, each system was minimized for 500 steps of steepest-descent minimization and heated gradually from 0 to 300 K for 100 ps of NVT molecular dynamics simulation using the V-rescale thermostat, followed by 100 ps of NPT simulation using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a 2 ps time constant and the isothermal compressibility of water 4.5×10−5 bar−1. Data collection under the same conditions was run for 100 ns of MD simulation, with forces and coordinates saved every 100 ps to give 1000 frames. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Partial Mesh Ewald (PME) method with the Verlet cutoff-scheme, the non-bonded cutoff was 10 angstroms with periodic boundary conditions, and the time step was 2 fs. Free energies of binding were calculated using the Energy-Entropy (EE) method from energy and entropy differences. Energies were taken as the average simulation potential and kinetic energy, neglecting the small pressure-volume term. Entropies were calculated using Multiscale Cell Correlation (MCC) (10.3390/e21080750) with additional terms for binding (10.1021/jp809968p). Calculation of all necessary terms was implemented in two separate in-house python codes, one for the solutes and one for the solvent, each reading in the force, coordinate and topology files from each simulation.
